# 🔐 Voided Authentication System

A community-driven implementation of the [Voided.to](https://voided.to) user authentication logic — supporting multiple languages and environments. Authenticate users using their API key, validate usergroups, and manage access control with ease.

> 💡 This repository contains implementations in **C#**, **Node.js**, and potentially more — contributed and maintained by developers who love to build smarter tooling on top of the Voided platform.

---

## 🚀 What is This?

This repo provides reusable logic to authenticate users from Voided.to using their developer API. Each implementation checks:
- If a user key is valid
- If the salt is valid (not expired)
- If the user belongs to a required user group
- And returns meaningful details back to your app

## 🛠️ Developer Notes

- You'll need a `provider` and `salt` from Voided developer.
- Always use environment variables to store your API keys or salts (`.env`, `process.env`, etc.).
- Never expose secrets in public repositories!
